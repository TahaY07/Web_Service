## Creating a web service and management it
In this example, we’ll create a simple RESTful web service using Fast API. We’ll focus on the basics of setting up the service, defining endpoints, and handling requests.

# Requirements
Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x & Fast API 
- A code editor (suggest Vsc)
- Postgresql
